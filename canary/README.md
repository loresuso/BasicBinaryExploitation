# Lessons learned 

- :heavy_check_mark: <code>canary_1</code>: we can always combine a buffer overflow vulnerability with a format string one. In particular, we can read the canary with the format string and then overflow the buffer, paying attention on rewriting the buffer as is and then redirecting the flow by overwriting the return address.
- :heavy_check_mark: <code>canary_2</code>: a format string is enough to redirect the flow to any function. It is just a bit more difficult, but you can bypass the canary and directly write the return address. You may need to bruteforce the address where the return address is stored.
- :heavy_check_mark: <code>canary_3</code>: if an attacker can control how many bytes are read and then overflow, a bruteforcing of the canary can be put in place. Try adding one byte at a time and see what happens: if the program crashes, means it was a wrong byte, otherwise you have guessed one byte of the canary. Continue until you get the complete canary.
