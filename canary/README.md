# Bypassing canary protection
This exercises were aimed at learning how to bypass canary protection. Each server can be run with the command 
```
./run ./server_*
```
where instead of * you can put the number of the server you are working on. 

## Lessons learned :heavy_check_mark:

- <code>canary_0</code>: this server has both a buffer overflow and a format string vulnerability, that were combined in the solution. In particular, the canary was read with the format string. Then, the buffer was overflowed, overwriting the canary with the right value and redirecting the execution flow to win().

- <code>canary_1</code>: this server has only a format string vulnerability. It was used to directly write at the address where the return address is saved. Since we are attacking the server remotely, we cannot be sure of where it is saved in the stack of the remote process, so bruteforcing the address of the saved return address is needed. 

- <code>canary_2</code>: this server has a buffer overflow vulnerability and the attacker can also control how many bytes can be written after the end of the buffer. The idea is to bruteforce the canary by guessing one byte at a time and then redirect the flow of the program.
