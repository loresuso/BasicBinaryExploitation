# Lessons learned 

- <code>canary_1</code>: we can always combine a buffer overflow vulnerability with a format string one. In particular, we can read the canary with the format string and then overflow the buffer, paying attention on rewriting the buffer as is and then redirecting the flow by overwriting the return address.
- <code>canary_2</code>: a format string is enough to redirect the flow to any function. It is just a bit more difficult, but you can bypass the canary and directly write the return address. 
- <code>canary_3</code>: if an attacker can control how much bytes are read and then overflow, a bruteforcing of the canary can be put in place.
