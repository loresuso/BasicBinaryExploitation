# Heap exploitation

Attacking heap metadata using the unlink() attack described in the Phrack article "once upon a free()", exploiting double free and use-after-free vulnerabilities. 

Very useful pointers to overwrite and redirect execution flow: 
- malloc_hook 
- free_hook 
- vpointer of C++ classes, pointing to the vtable (used to call the right function when the class itself has virtual functions. The vpointer is at the beginning of the memory allocated to store the object of the specified class and you can see that the constructor put it when constructing the object itself)
- (and of course the GOT if you FUllRelro is disabled)

Furthermore, to exploit double free or use-after-free vulns you have to have control on the ordering of each free and malloc and a buggy program. 
It's important to notice that you have also to allocate chunks of specific sizes to make use of fast bins!
