All servers are listening on lettieri.iet.unipi.it, on the following ports:
	
	server_0	7000
	server_1	7001
	server_2	7002

The current directory of each server contains a 'flag.txt' file.

The bin directory contains a copy of the actual binaries that are running
on the remote machine. There is also a copy of the binary C library that
they are using.
